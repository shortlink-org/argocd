# 1. Use CI/CD

Date: 2023-09-14

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We have a need for a CI/CD pipeline to automate the testing and deployment of our services.

### History

Previously, we utilized Travis CI for our CI/CD needs. However, due to the discontinuation of their free version, 
we transitioned to the inferior-mentioned tools to better suit our requirements and budget constraints.

## Decision

| Tool/Service   | Purpose                                             | Documentation Link                                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| GitHub Actions | Base checks and dependency updates (via Dependabot) | [GitHub Actions Docs](https://docs.github.com/actions)             |
| GitLab CI      | Full cycle: Testing and Building                    | [GitLab CI Docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/)                   |
| ArgoCD         | Deployment of services                              | [ArgoCD Docs](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)           |
| Helm Dashboard | Helm UI manager                                     | [Helm Dashboard Docs](https://github.com/komodorio/helm-dashboard) |

## Consequences

We are able to utilize the best of each tool to create a robust CI/CD pipeline.

 - **GitHub Actions** üöÄ - GitHub Actions streamline our base checks and dependency updates, acting as the go-to guru for our code and CI/CD pipeline.
 - **GitLab CI** üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è - GitLab CI is our wizard for full-cycle testing and building, keeping our code and CI/CD pipeline in sync. 
We've mirrored our GitHub repository to GitLab, making magic happen.
 - **ArgoCD** üõ†Ô∏è - ArgoCD skillfully handles our service deployments, ensuring our code and CI/CD pipeline sing the same tune.
 - **Helm Dashboard** üìä - The Helm Dashboard, functioning as our Helm UI manager.
